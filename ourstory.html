I am currently a student at the University of Missouri, Kanas City and am studying to be a scenic designer. I love spending time with friends and family, creating art and reading.

						<h1 class="indent">How We Met</h1>
						<p class="indent">I decided to move to Kansas City from southern California five years ago. I ended up getting a job at Raglan Road, an Irish pub in the Power and Light District. It was there that I met Matthew, who was a bartender. At first we were friends and then our friendship developed into a relationship. We have had a blast exploring the city, learning about each other, and going on adventures. Matthew has been a great friend, boyfriend, and now fiancee and I know that he will be a great husband.</p>

						<h1 class="indent">We're Engaged!</h1>
						<p class="indent">We were about to embark on a great vacation that we had planned to southern California and Hawaii to visit family. The first stop was southern California. Matt had planned this engagement for a long time and knew the perfect time to take me by surprise. My family planned a day trip to the Stone Brewing Company for beer tasting. While we were enjoying delicious beer and food Matt asked me to take a walk through the garden. As we were walking one of the servers delivered us a surprise dessert! When I looked at the plate I saw a beer tasting flight, the big engagement question written in chocolate and a gorgeous engagement ring! I couldn't stop smiling when he asked me to be his wife and immediately said YES! </p>
