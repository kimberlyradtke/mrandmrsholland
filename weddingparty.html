					<h1>Kimberly Radtke</h1>
					<h2>Matron of Honor</h2>
					<p>Kim is my little sister, and though we had our common sisterly arguments and fights in our childhood, we have grown up to have a great relationship! Now the little sister who followed me around and tormented me will be standing by my side as my Matron of Honor. She is currently attending school for graphic design and is busy spending time with her husband Herman and chasing her son around.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Sara Wallace</h1>
					<h2>Bridesmaid</h2>
					<p>Being Matthew's sister, we met at a New Year's family get-together at the Holland house, complete with home-made egg rolls. She (along with Grandma) are the family dessert bakers, and she makes sure to provide delicious cheesecakes to every family function.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Erin Beffa</h1>
					<h2>Bridesmaid</h2>
					<p>Erin and I also met during the fall of 2008. Erin moved to Kansas City after graduating from Truman State in Kirksville. Erin now works as a chocolate-maker at Annadore's Fine Chocolates. She always tries to make time for the ceramics studio where she also works. She loves to create mugs, big bowls, and everything in between. In addition to loving her car, she loves her sweetheart Justin.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Lisa McDonald</h1>
					<h2>Bridesmaid</h2>
					<p>Lisa and I met while waiting tables at Raglan Road, and extended our friendship with weekly trips to the local piano bar. She currently lives in Columbia, Missouri, and can just hurry right on up and move back to Kansas City at any time.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Matthew Miller</h1>
					<h2>Bridesman</h2>

					<h1>Loren Proffitt</h1>
					<h2>Best Man</h2>
					<p>When I met this young man we were knee high to a grasshopper waiting for the bus at his grandparents house. We have been friends throughout grade school, good times with 4-H, and all of the way up to high school, having our first drink together way back in the day, out in the woods at my parent's house.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Micheal Holland</h1>
					<h2>Groomsman</h2>
					<p>Micheal is my brother. He is a member of the Air Force and is stationed in Hawaii. He lives with his wife, Inge and his son, Eli.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Randy Spillman</h1>
					<h2>Groomsman</h2>
					<p>Our friendship started back when I worked at Joe's Crab Shack about 8 years ago. In between many a Chiefs game, midnight sand volleyball games and a few parties with the Cap'n, our friendship grew. Now we pass the time drinking lots of wonderful beer, practicing zombie killing and watching the Kansas City Chiefs lose.</p>
<hr>
					<h1>Clint Crabtree</h1>
					<h2>Groomsman</h2>

<hr>
					<h1>Spudd Richards</h1>
					<h2>Officiant</h2>
					<p>When Spudd rolled into Richmond back in middle school he made friends fast and I am glad to say that he is a great friend of mine. Our friendship started in the band room in 6th grade and continued throughout time in the high school band room with plenty of band water. To this day, I can find him playing that music at the local watering hole.</p>
